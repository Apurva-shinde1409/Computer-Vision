**Hand Tracking Project**
This project uses MediaPipe and OpenCV to perform real-time hand tracking. It detects and tracks hand landmarks from a webcam feed, allowing you to extract the positions of specific points on the hand for further use (e.g., gesture recognition).

**Features**
Real-time hand detection and landmark tracking.
Modularized HandTrackingModule for easy integration into other projects.
FPS display for performance monitoring.
Customizable options to toggle landmark drawing and tracking.

**Modules**
HandTrackingModule.py: Contains a reusable handDetector class to simplify hand detection and landmark extraction.
Basics.py: Demonstrates basic hand tracking functionality.
ProjectExample.py: An example of integrating the handDetector class into a project.

**Applications**
Gesture recognition.
Virtual controls (e.g., controlling devices with hand movements).
Real-time interactive projects.
